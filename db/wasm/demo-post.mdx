# WebAssembly (Wasm)

## Introduction

WebAssembly (Wasm) is a binary instruction format that enables high-performance execution on web browsers. It allows running code written in languages like C, C++, and Rust at near-native speed in the browser. WebAssembly is designed to be efficient, secure, and portable, opening new possibilities for web development.
