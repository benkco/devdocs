# Svelte

## Introduction

Svelte is a JavaScript framework that compiles components at build time, resulting in highly optimized and efficient code. It shifts the work from the browser to the build step, producing smaller bundles and improving runtime performance. Svelte is known for its simplicity and the absence of a runtime framework in the final output.
