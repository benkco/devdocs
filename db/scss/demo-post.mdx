# SCSS (Sass)

## Introduction

SCSS (Sass) is a preprocessor scripting language that is interpreted or compiled into Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). It extends CSS by providing features like variables, nested rules, and mixins, making stylesheets more maintainable and scalable. SCSS is widely used in web development to enhance the styling capabilities of CSS.
