# C Programming Language

## Introduction

C is a powerful and widely used programming language that was first developed in the 1970s. C is considered a low-level language, meaning it is closer to the hardware and gives more control over the memory and performance of the program. C is used for creating a variety of programs, such as operating systems, compilers, libraries, games, and embedded systems. C is also the basis for many other programming languages, such as C++, Java, and Python.
