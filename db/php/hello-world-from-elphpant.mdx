# Hello World from PHP

## Introduction

PHP is awesome. What do I mean with that is by time we'll see how powerful it is in aspect of web world it's just need,
some asynchronous like ReactPHP or something like fibers but that some way more advanced stuff here we just need that:
```php
echo "Hello, World!";
```
