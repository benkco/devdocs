# CSS

## Introduction

CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets, a language that describes how HTML elements are displayed on a web page. CSS allows web developers to separate the presentation of a web page from its content, making it easier to maintain and modify. CSS can control the layout, colors, fonts, animations, transitions, and other aspects of the web page's appearance. CSS can also adapt the web page to different devices, such as desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.
