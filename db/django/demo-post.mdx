# Django Framework

## Introduction

Django is a high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. It follows the "Don't Repeat Yourself" (DRY) principle and focuses on automating as much as possible. Django provides an ORM, admin interface, and follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern, making it a powerful choice for web development.
