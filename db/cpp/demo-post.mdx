# C++ Programming Language

## Introduction

C++ is an extension of the C programming language, adding features such as object-oriented programming, generic programming, and exception handling. C++ is widely used for developing high-performance applications, such as games, operating systems, browsers, and compilers. C++ is also compatible with C, meaning that C code can be easily incorporated into C++ programs.
