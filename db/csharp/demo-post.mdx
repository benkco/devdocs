# C# Programming Language

## Introduction

C# is a modern, general-purpose, object-oriented programming language designed by Microsoft. C# is mainly used for developing applications that run on the .NET Framework, a software platform that provides a wide range of services, such as memory management, security, networking, and database access. C# supports multiple programming paradigms, such as imperative, declarative, functional, and concurrent. C# is also compatible with other .NET languages, such as Visual Basic and F#.
