# Angular Framework

## Introduction

Angular is a popular open-source web application framework that allows developers to create dynamic, single-page applications using HTML, CSS, and TypeScript. Angular is based on the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture and supports two-way data binding, dependency injection, routing, testing, and more. Angular is maintained by Google and a community of developers and organizations.
